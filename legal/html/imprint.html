                            Small entrepreneurs within the meaning of Section 19 (1) UStG have the right to choose whether or not to pay VAT. If they decide not to pay VAT, they generally do not need a VAT identification number. Accordingly, they do not have to state a VAT identification number in the imprint. In addition, small entrepreneurs are often not entered in the commercial register, so that no details are required. However, if there is an entry in the register or a VAT identification number has been issued, the relevant information must be provided. The sample is based on the assumption that there is no VAT identification number and that the operator of the website is not entered in the commercial register. In addition, a journalistic-editorial offer was assumed for the model, so that the ladder identification was included separately in accordance with Section 55 (2) RStV.
